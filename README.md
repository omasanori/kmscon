# KMSCON

kmscon is a simple terminal emulator based on linux kernel mode setting (KMS).
It is an attempt to replace the in-kernel VT implementation with a userspace
console. See `kmscon(1)` man-page for usage information.

## Requirements

Kmscon requires the following software:

- libtsm: terminal emulator state machine
  https://github.com/Aetf/libtsm
- libudev: providing input, video, etc. device hotplug support (>=v172)
  http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/
- libxkbcommon: providing internationalized keyboard handling
  http://xkbcommon.org/
- libdrm: graphics access to DRM/KMS subsystem
- linux-headers: linux kernel headers for ABI definitions

Everything else is optional:

For video output at least one of the following is required:

- fbdev: For framebuffer video output the kernel headers must be installed
  and located in the default include path.
- DRM: For unaccelerated drm output the "libdrm" library must be installed
  and accessible via pkg-config.
- OpenGLES2: For accelerated video output via OpenGLESv2 the following must
  be installed: libdrm, libgbm, egl, glesv2 (i.e., mesa)

For font handling the following is required:

- 8x16: The 8x16 font is a static built-in font which does not require
  external dependencies.
- unifont: Static font without external dependencies.
- pango: drawing text with pango
  Pango requires: glib, pango, fontconfig, freetype2 and more

For multi-seat support you need the following packages:

- systemd: Actually only the systemd-logind daemon and library is required.

## Download

## Install

- Ubuntu Server 18.04

```
$ apt install -y libudev-dev libxkbcommon-dev libdrm-dev linux-headers-$(uname -r)
$ cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/Aetf/libtsm && cd libstm
$ test -f ./configure || NOCONFIGURE=1 ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
$ cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/Aetf/kmscon && cd kmscon
$ test -f ./configure || NOCONFIGURE=1 ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
```

If you want only a very basic kmscon program without any major dependencies,
use:
    $ ./configure --with-video=fbdev,drm2d --with-renderers= --with-fonts=unifont --disable-multi-seat --with-sessions=dummy,terminal
However, you will loose a lot of functionality by dropping all dependencies.

The following configure options are available. If build-time dependencies
cannot be satisfied, an option is automatically turned off, except if you
explicitly enable it via command line:
  --enable-multi-seat: This requires the systemd-logind library to provide
                       multi-seat support for kmscon. [default: on]
  --enable-debug: Enable debug mode/messages [default: on]
  --enable-optimizations: Enable code optimizations [default: on]

Backends for several subsystems in kmscon can be selected with the following
options (all of them take a comma-separated list of backend names):
  --with-video: Video backens. Available backends are:
     - fbdev: Linux fbdev video backend
     - drm2d: Linux DRM software-rendering backend
     - drm3d: Linux DRM hardware-rendering backend
     Default is: fbdev,drm2d,drm3d
  --with-fonts: Font renderers. Available backends are:
     - unifont: Static built-in non-scalable font (Unicode Unifont)
     - pango: Pango based scalable font renderer
     Default is: unifont,pango
     The 8x16 backend is always built-in.
  --with-renderers: Console rendering backends. Available are:
     - bbulk: Simple 2D software-renderer (bulk-mode)
     - gltex: OpenGLESv2 accelerated renderer
     - pixman: pixman based renderer
     Default is: bbulk,gltex
     The bblit backend is always built-in.
  --with-sessions: Built in sessions. Available sessions are:
     - dummy: Dummy fallback session
     - terminal: Terminal-emulator sessions

## Running

  ** kmscon must be run as root **

  ```
  $ sudo LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
  $ sudo export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  $ sudo kmscon
  ```

  To get usage information, run:
  ```
  $ ./kmscon --help
  ```

  You can then run kmscon with:
  ```
  $ ./kmscon [options]
  ```

  For debug output use "--debug". For verbose output use "--verbose".
  With "--xkb-layout=<lang>" you can switch the keyboard layout.
  See "man kmscon" / kmscon(1) for more information.
